Some studies state that a fracture of the ulnar styloid process does not significantly affect functional outcome after a distal radius fracture in terms of patient-reported outcomes, range of motion and grip strength. Other studies show a negative effect of a concomitant ulnar styloid process fracture on functional outcomes .The rationale behind choosing this study is to assess the benefit of addressing  ulnar styloid fractures associated with  distal end of radius fracture so as to benefit into the functional outcome.
