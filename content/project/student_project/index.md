In ortho wards , I have seen that many of the hip fracture patients after surgery have developed delirium and they were restrained. Most of them were elderly people. Most often, their complete return to the preinjury level is not achieved. Also, only a few studies have been conducted about the association between perioperative hypotension and PD in elderly hip fracture patients and among the Indian population it is further less. Therefore, through this study, I would like to find out the prevalence of PD and whether there is any association between  intraoperative hypotension and postoperative delirium in hip fracture patients.
