# What is education?

Education is about more than setting up a fish (knowledge) distribution centre and handing fish out to all who come to the institution.

Education is about fishing lessons

It equips people with the competence and confidence to fish (learn) for the rest of their lives.

This is not simply about job preparation. This is preparation for life

## Art of learning: 8 simple ideas for you
---
## 1. Learn in depth
- Investigate a single word
- Do it until you graduate from here
- Look at it from different disciplines (Biology, Literature, Statistics, etc..)
- I would suggest this word: SDL
---
## 2. Create “My” learning journal
- Digital or Physical
- Explore
  - What am I learning?
  - Why am I learning?
  - How am I learning?
  - Where am I learning?
---

## 3. Enroll in a MOOC

- edx
- Coursera
- P2P University
---

## 4.Build a learning network
---

## 5.Find a problem, solve it and report it

- Become an expert in that
- do this as a project or as a paper
---
## 6.Flipped class

- Learn by teaching
- create your own content and resourses
---

## 7. “How do i do it”

- Show and tell
- Share how you learned something
---

## 8. Vocation of student

- Vocation means “calling”
- Think about your role of a student as a vocation
- <mark>**Think: “Why am I studying?”**</mark>
