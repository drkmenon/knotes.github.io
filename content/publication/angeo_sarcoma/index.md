abstract: The current article describes a case of multicentric EA of the spine that presented simultaneously at T4 spine and the posterior one third of the left fourth rib. STUDY DESIGN/SETTINGS This study included a patient with a rare spinal tumor, which presented insidiously. Radiologically, the lesions were osteolytic with erosion of cortices. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of malignant cells with epithelioid morphology with areas of vascular differentiation, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Anastomosing vascular spaces lined by epithelioid endothelial cells suggested focal endotheliod differentiation.

summary:  It is important to differentiate EA from other tumors because the clinical course and treatment are specific for these conditions. Careful histologic and immunohistochemical analysis will clinch the diagnosis. Even though rare, we stress the importance to be aware of the existence of this tumor, which is essential for correct diagnosis.
