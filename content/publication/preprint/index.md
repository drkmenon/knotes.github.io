 abstract: INTRODUCTION- More students are posted in the orthopaedic out-patient departments than before. Lack of clinical space to accommodate students is a frequently cited problem. Virtual learning allows for an adjustable location and is scalable. We aimed to compare both the effectiveness and student satisfaction level between onsite virtual classroom and physical classroom in teaching orthopaedics to a group of undergraduate medical students. METHODS- A quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design study was conducted with 49 final-year medical students participating in orthopaedic training between November 2019 to January 2020. These students were randomly allocated into two groups, experimental (virtual classroom) and comparison (physical learning). The experimental group received an onsite virtual learning environment, whereas the control group received the same content in a physical classroom. Pre and post-tests that consisted of multiple choice questions were administered. At the end of the class, the students completed a 5-point Likert scale satisfaction level evaluation questionnaire. RESULTS- The post-test knowledge scores between virtual classroom (M=78.2,SD=12.74) and Physical classroom (M=77.92,SD=10.31) were not different (z= 0.00, p=1.00). Though the overall perceptions of learning were positive, some frustrations were apparent and the student satisfaction was significantly better (z=-4.60, p value=0.00) with the physical classroom (M=3.83,SD=0.16) compared to virtual classroom (M=3.5,SD=0.23). CONCLUSION- Onsite virtual activities are not as satisfying as physical classroom in the opinion of the students, but they are successful strategies in learning that can be used in outpatient orthopaedic clinics to address the problem of lack of space. Students learn content focused on orthopaedic clinical learning objectives as well using onsite virtual classroom as they do in the traditional classroom setting.
