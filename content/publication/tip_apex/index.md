abstract: PURPOSE To test the significance of calcar referenced tip apex distance  and the length of antirotation screw  as predictors for failure after biaxial cephalomedullary  nailing of intertrochanteric fractures. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 190 consecutive fractures that had undergone biaxial CM nailing. Of these, 67 met the inclusion criteria of a non-pathological fracture with a minimum of 90 days radiological follow-up RESULTS The overall failure rate was 15. Failure was associated with a higher CalTAD in most of the patients . A higher tip apex distance  was not significantly associated with failure, when the CalTAD was less than 25 mm. When the AR screw length exceeded a line connecting the tip of the nail and the lag screw, screw cutout occurred only in one patient . CONCLUSION Our data provide the first reported clinical evidence that the CalTAD is a better predictor of cutout in biaxial CM nailing than TAD measurement. However, the length of antirotational element does not seem to be an independent predictor of CM nailing failure.
