abstract: OBJECTIVE  A retrospective study was carried out in patients with giant cell tumor of bone to compare the functional and radiographic outcome of curettage and bone grafting using a novel CT based selection strategy to that of patients of a similar age treated with anatomic/standard curettage and bone grafting.METHODS Curettage and bone grafting after CT classification was performed in 31 patients and curettage and bone grafting without CT classification in 20. The surgical approach for curettage in the CT classified group of patients was through the site of the cortical break, irrespective of the standard approach to the particular region of bone involved. The aim of this approach was to achieve wide excision of the possibly involved soft tissue.RESULTS At similar duration of follow up  in patients with a similar mean age , Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores for CT classified patients were similar to those of patients who had undergone standard curettage. However, the postoperative recurrence rate in the CT classified group was significantly less  than in the nonCT classified group.CONCLUSION A CT based selection strategy is a valid preoperative tool for evaluation of giant cell tumor. Further, for curettage these lesions are better approached through the site of cortical break, irrespective of standard approaches, so that adequate soft tissue clearance can be achieved.
