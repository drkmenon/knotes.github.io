abstract: Gluteal abscess is a well-documented presentation of a caries spine and other local bony foci of tuberculosis. Still, during a PUBMED data search, only one report of vertebral tuberculosis presenting only as a gluteal abscess in adults was found in English medical literature. The current article describes a case of tuberculosis of the lumbar spine with gluteal abscess as the only clinical feature, in an immunocompetent young adult.
