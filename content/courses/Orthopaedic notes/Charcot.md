## Definition
<font color="emerald">It is a non infectious,destructive process culminating in dislocations and periarticular fractures in patients with peripheral neuropathy and loss of protective sensations</font>

0.1 to 29% incidence

50% need one operation in life time

15-67% chance of amputation

## Clinical features
- Pain
- Local rise of temparature >3-5<sup>0</sup> compared to normal
- Swelling
- Deformity

## Cahrcot vs Infection

|Charcor|Infection|
|--|--|
|Limb elevation decreases inflammation|No|
|No |Increased ESR,CRP,IL6|
|No |Istope (In +Tc)scan positive, PET positive|

## Classification

### Eichenholtz

|Stage|Name|Features|
|--|--|--|
|0|Prefragmentation|Inflammation|
|1|Fragmentation|Subluxation,dislocation|
|2|Coalascence|decreased inflammation|bone resorption|
|3|Consolidation|No inflammation|OA in X Ray|

### Progression

0-1 in 6 months and 2-3 in 12-14 months

### Causes

- Endocrine: DM, Renal failure, Alcohol
_ Infection: Leprosy, syphilis
- Neurogenic: CP, Syrinx,Myelomeningocele, cord injury
- Idiopathic

## Theories

- Neurotraumatic
- Neurovascular
_ Inflammatory theory (Favoured)
  Here injury lead to inflammation and activate RANK-RANKL pathway leading to bone resorption
  
## management principles
