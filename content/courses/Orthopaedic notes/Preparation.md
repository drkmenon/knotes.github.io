Here I'll share my personal experience and tips for FRCS (Tr & Orth) preparation:

## Introduction
**Evolution of Orthopaedic training examination in UK**
>+ The old-style FRCS: Until late 1970s.
>+ MCh(Orth) from the University of Liverpool: Now obsolete
>+ OPTIONAL Specialty Fellowship exam in orthopaedics in 1979.
>+ A new intercollegiate exam was introduced in 1990, which was accepted by all four Royal Colleges.
>+ In 1991 FRCS became a requirement for accreditation.
>+ The four Surgical Royal Colleges (Edinburgh, England, Glasgow & Ireland) in 2015 introduced a new suite of Intercollegiate Fellowship Examinations for the international surgical community.
>+ The JSCFE has parity of standard with the existing UK/Ireland Intercollegiate Fellowship. Examinations and is recognised by GMC for Speciality registration.   

## Examination Pattern
The current International FRCS (Tr & Orth) exam encompasses two sections: Part I is a written exam and Part II the clinical and oral exam. For further information, and to make sure that your information is up to date, I suggest that you carefully review the Intercollegiate Speciality Board website. [This is the link](http://www.jscfe.org.uk).
##### Part I
This section consists of two separate papers ( a Computer Based Testing-CBT); essentially, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) paper (2 Hours) and an extended matching question (EMQ) paper (2 hours 30 minutes). Part I is generally regarded as the easier section of exam to pass. A number of candidates may be OK learning for an MCQ/EMI paper but be a long way off the standard for a clinical and viva exam.  

Format of Section 1 examination changes from 2021  

The GMC has approved an alteration to the format of the Section 1 examination. The following format is applicable to all Section 1 examinations from January 2021:  

Paper 1 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)  

Paper 2 – 120 Single Best [SBA] (2 hours 15 mins)  

How to apply  

https://www.jscfe.co.uk is the official website for registering and applying for the examination. It costs £520.00 for Part I application and £1,785.00 for Part II. To apply,

**Section 2**:Candidates will have a maximum of 4 attempts with no re-entry  

## Preparing for Part I
Like any other thing in life, there are multiple paths for Part I preparation. Rather than enumerating, I would describe what worked out for me. I believe that, at least 5 months of intense preparation is necessary before you can confidently appear for Part I. Focused preparation begins after the successful submission of application. So, before paying the exam fees, make sure that at least 5-6 months are left for the preparation. It is a good first to answer all the Orthobullets questions to get an idea of where you stand. My score was 40%. I bought Miller’s Review of Orthopaedics and started learning. I spent nearly 5-6 hours reading Miller/attempting Orthobullets questions. My strategy was to read Miller as much as I can and as quickly as possible so as to revise at-least 3-4 times. My strategy for Orthobullets questions was similar. My target was 150-200 questions per day, with 3-4 revisions before exam. 1 month before the Part I exam, I bought paid questions in the Orthobullets and BMJ OnExamination which I believe, though expensive, gave me an extra edge and confidence.  

##### My Part I preparation in nutshell was
Miller’s review of orthopaedics latest edition, page-to-page, 4 revisions  

Orthobullets free questions, 3 revisions  

Orthobullets paid questions  

BMJ OnExamination  

Total 5-6 months preparation spending 5-6 hours on an average daily.

 
## Actual Part I exam experience
Just like any other examination in the past, I reached the city 1 day prier to the exam date. I stayed at a decent 4-star hotel which was located at a walkable distance from the Pearson VUE test Centre. My exam was in the afternoon. I woke up at 6 am. My plan was to brush through the entire Miller before noon, which I did. This gave me a fresh confidence. Had a nice meal and I packed some food to the exam hall.  

I consciously abstained from reading/talking anything related to exam from there. Luckily I knew no-one in the exam hall, so I could escape to one corner in the waiting area. I read lightly from my Kindle something other than Orthopaedics and relaxed.  

An official checked our passport and gave a brief introduction. I kept all my belongings in to a designated locker, including my mobile after switching off. I was escorted to the test area, and after frisking, was given a pen and a paper for rough work and was taken to the CBT console. Total duration of the exam was 5 hours (2 hours SBA, 2 hours 30 minutes EMQ, 30 minutes break in between). During the break, I was allowed to open the locker, take out my packed food and eat from the waiting area. There were no refreshments provided except for drinking water. The topics/questions I could remember are summarised here  

##### The paper
My plan was to see all the questions as quickly as possible and mark the sure shot answers. Then I came back and spent some time on questions which demanded some pondering. Then I came back again to reconsider and review the already answered questions. The flagged questions, the answers of which were not known to me were then reviewed and made some educated guesses. Luckily, still I felt as if I had lot of time.  

##### The result
The result came as an email from the CHAIR, JSCFE SPECIALTY BOARD IN TRAUMA & ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY exactly 20 days after the examination. It also included the breakdown of the result. Mean minimum score required to proceed to Part II was 61.46%. My mean score was 73.39%.  

## Part II preparation
During the 3 weeks waiting period, I made some internet search and made a tentative plan for Part II preparation, in case I could clear the exam. I was equally thinking about mentally preparing myself to resit the Part I ( Though I had no clue about alternative preparation method or my ability to stretch beyond the limits of my initial preparation). It later turned out to be good 1 year gap for the preparation.My plan for Part II can be summarised as below.  

 1. Attend preparatory course  
 2. Buy clinical and viva study materials
 3. Take classes for residents
 4. Standardise the clinical examination method See as much patients as I can
 5. Make notes for quick revision  
 6. Combined study  

## Preparatory course(s)
I stumbled upon and intuitively selected two courses, which turned out to be real gems in due course,  

##### Postgraduate Orthopaedics Revision course by Postgraduate Orthopaedics  

##### The FRCS Mentor Network (Offline youtube videos)  

##### Postgraduate Orthopaedics Revision course by Paul Banaszkiewicz
This is an intense 6 day course covering all the A list/core topics for Part II. I attended the course twice. One in the very beginning of the Part II preparation and another at the end of my preparation to “iron out my technique”, just before exam. The course helped in two fronts; first it helped me to develop a systems approach and secondly it grilled in the concept of **“Higher order thinking”**.   

##### The FRCS Mentor Network (Offline youtube videos)
Shwan and Firas Arnaout are doing wonderful work in preparing candidates through online group. I regularly listened to their youtube uploads, and believe that this really helped me in developing confidence and foresee the real clinical and viva stations. FRCS mentor group some how introduced me to another gem, videos by Quen Tang.  

##### Quen Tang videos
This introduced me to two important concepts  

  + Structured answering in viva using A4 sheet of paper and pencil  
  
  + Sleek and crisp presentation  
  
## Clinical and viva study material
I stuck to these  

* Postgraduate Orthopaedics: The Candidate’s Guide to the FRCS (Tr & Orth) Examination
* Postgraduate Orthopaedics: Viva Guide for the FRCS (Tr & Orth) Examination
* Examination Techniques in Orthopaedics by Nick Harris, Fazal Ali
* Pictures from revision notes by @Joideep Phadnis
* Pictures from Atlas of human anatomy


## Combined study
During the last 2-3 months of preparation, I utilised Zoom application for discussions with my friend Praveen C R.
## The Clinical and viva
As usual I reached well in advance before the exam, in fact 2 days earlier. I stayed in the same hotel where viva was supposed to be conducted. Unfortunately, I developed allergic rhinitis and was really worried.
## Clinicals, Day 1  
I felt quite distracted by the rhinitis and the fellow candidates, with lot of speculative discussions in the air both in the hotel and in the exam hall. I tried not to get carried away and keep focused. I had the short cases first and had to be really on my toes and time fled like anything. My performance was pretty average or possibly bad in 2 stations. Luckily the rhinitis did not come in the way.I tried to forget those stations and tried to focus myself before the intermediate case, sitting away from fellow noisy candidates. I practiced structured history taking by writing down individual questions for standard patient interrogation. In the intermediate case station (PLIF patient with foot drop), I felt more confident and was able to control the situation to a large extend.
## Viva, Day 2
Viva was in the morning, but I had lot of time with out any distraction before that. I could revise my entire notes before viva. I could remain focused. Only problem was dry cough, which I tried to ignore. All the questions were familiar to me and I controlled the discussion to a great extend except in the basic science station. There I performed rather poorly, but my overall performance was good.
## Dress code
Of course there is no dress code for Part I. For the clinicals, the principle is to be bare below the elbow. Tie is not mandatory. But I preferred to wear one with the end tucked into the Light blue shirt. I wore dark blue trousers and black formal shoes. You are expected to wear a suit for the viva. I wore a dark blue one and a white shirt. The board expects you and only you for the examination. This means no need to carry any examination kit.
## Result
Result came as an email from the CHAIR, JSCFE SPECIALTY BOARD IN TRAUMA & ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY exactly 10 days after the examination. The email just informed me that I have been successful.
