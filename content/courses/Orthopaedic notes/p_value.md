### p value and its statistical basis

**Introduction**

#### Talking the talk

Please see the abstract below:

![p value](/img/p.png)**Figure 1   
Doctor,what do you mean by p value?**

{{% callout note %}}
p value is the point estimate of chance of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis
{{% /callout %}}  

Assume that we have a normally distributed population of old ladies with a mean T score of -3. That means they have osteoporosis as a population. Now consider we are conducting a clinical trial in which Alendronate is give and after that T score has become -2.

The null hypothesis argues that this difference is due to **chance** and it is statistically insignificant

The alternate hypothesis makes an contrary argument; the difference is statistically significant.

**The researcher has to make a decision**. In research, convention is to reject null hypothesis if the test result is outside the 95% mark in the normal curve. The remaining 5% is called `œ`. The boundary is approximately `1.96z`. 
>`œ` is the zone of rejection of null hypothesis and `z` the boundary between the acceptance and rejection zones of  null hypothesis.

If we refer the statistical charts, p value for a `z` score of 1.96 is ≤0.05

If we go back to the second figure, we can see that the test result lies in the zone of rejection and the p value for this would be ≤0.05, which is statistically significant

Another important concept is **confidence interval**

### Confidence interval

{{% callout note %}}
It is the range with in which the population mean is likely to lie with respect to the sample mean
{{% /callout %}}

It ranges between a fixed value x and y on either side of zero,i.e., `x-0-y`. 

0-x is the lower confidence limit and 0+y is the upper confidence limit.

### **Confidence limit**
 This sets the boundary of confidence interval and it is generally taken as 95%.

confidence interval is generally considered as more important than p value because it gives

+ Statistical significance
+ Clinical significance
+ Precision
